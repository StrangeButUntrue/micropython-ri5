MicroPython libraries
=====================

.. warning::

   Important summary of this section

   * MicroPython implements a subset of Python functionality for each module.
   * To ease extensibility, MicroPython versions of standard Python modules
     usually have ``u`` ("micro") prefix.
   * Additions/deletions/modifications from the base Micropython version are
     indicated within the document.


This chapter describes modules (function and class libraries) which are built
into MicroPython. There are a few categories of such modules:

* Modules which implement a subset of standard Python functionality and are not
  intended to be extended by the user.
* Modules which implement a subset of Python functionality, with a provision
  for extension by the user (via Python code).
* Modules which implement MicroPython extensions to the Python standard libraries.
* Modules specific to this particular `MicroPython port` and thus not portable.

Note about the availability of the modules and their contents: This documentation
in general aspires to describe all modules and functions/classes which are
implemented in MicroPython project. However, MicroPython is highly configurable, and
each port to a particular board/embedded system makes available only a subset
of MicroPython libraries. For officially supported ports, there is an effort
to either filter out non-applicable items, or mark individual descriptions
with "Availability:" clauses describing which ports provide a given feature.

You are able to discover the available, built-in libraries that can be
imported by entering the following at the REPL::

    help('modules')

Beyond the built-in libraries described in this documentation, many more
modules from the Python standard library, as well as further MicroPython
extensions to it, can be found in `micropython-lib`.

Python standard libraries and micro-libraries
---------------------------------------------

The following standard Python libraries have been "micro-ified" to fit in with
the philosophy of MicroPython.  They provide the core functionality of that
module and are intended to be a drop-in replacement for the standard Python
library.  Some modules below use a standard Python name, but prefixed with "u",
e.g. ``ujson`` instead of ``json``. This is to signify that such a module is
micro-library, i.e. implements only a subset of CPython module functionality.
By naming them differently, a user has a choice to write a Python-level module
to extend functionality for better compatibility with CPython (indeed, this is
what done by the `micropython-lib` project mentioned above).

In the RI5 port, since it may be cumbersome to add Python-level
wrapper modules to achieve naming compatibility with CPython, micro-modules
are available both by their u-name, and also by their non-u-name.  The
non-u-name can be overridden by a file of that name in your library path (``sys.path``).
For example, ``import json`` will first search for a file ``json.py`` (or package
directory ``json``) and load that module if it is found.  If nothing is found,
it will fallback to loading the built-in ``ujson`` module.

.. toctree::

   builtins.rst
   array.rst
   cmath.rst

   math.rst

   uio.rst
   ujson.rst
   uos.rst
   ure.rst
   uselect.rst
   ustruct.rst
   utime.rst
   uzlib.rst

These libraries do exist in MicroPython, but aren't in the base docs.

MicroPython-specific libraries
------------------------------

Functionality specific to the MicroPython implementation is available in
the following libraries.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   machine.rst
   micropython.rst
   uctypes.rst

These libraries do exist in MicroPython, but aren't in the base docs.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   utimeq.rst
   _onewire.rst

MicroPython default libraries unavailable
-----------------------------------------

Some default MicroPython functionality is missing from the Hub:

* usocket

* ussl

* _thread

* btree

* framebuf

* network

* ucryptolib

And some undocumented MicroPython modules that aren't in RI5:

* bluetooth

* lwip

* uasyncio (but note that the RI5 does have the async keyword)

* uwebsocket

* webrepl

Libraries specific to the Technic Hub
-------------------------------------

The following libraries are specific to the Technic Hub and are built into its Micropython.

.. toctree::
  :maxdepth: 1

  hub.rst
  firmware.rst

The following libraries are specific to the Technic Hub and are found in its filesystem.

.. toctree::
  :maxdepth: 1

  _api.rst
  commands.rst
  event_loop.rst
  mindstorms.rst
  programrunner.rst
  protocol.rst
  runtime.rst
  spike.rst
  system.rst
  ui.rst
  util.rst
  hub_runtime.rst
  version.rst

File main.py is also found in the filesystem, but do not import it as it will
restart the hub and require a battery removal/reinsert to get the hub working
again!  You can technically "import" boot, projects, sounds, extra_files, but
by default they're empty of Python content so they do nothing.
