:mod:`_api.util` -- utility functions for the API code
======================================================

.. module:: _api.util
   :synopsis: utility functions for the API code

This module contains functions used by the API functions.  (I don't believe
they're designed to be a part of the API as they're not obviously documented
anywhere.)

This module is imported by the `mindstorms` and `spike` modules so that the API
can be branded appropriately in documentation (i.e. so that Mindstorms docs can
tell you to import mindstorms, and Spike Prime docs can tell you to import
spike).
