:mod:`spike` -- Spike Prime branding of the user API
====================================================

This module seems to be purely designed as a frontend for the `_api` module,
so that Spike Prime documentation can tell its users to import a module with a
related name.

See `_api` for the majority of submodules and classes, all of which can also
be called from the spike module by using it as a synonym for "_api".

Classes
-------
.. class:: PrimeHub()

    Appears to have no methods and no obvious function, except perhaps as a
    way to distinguish this module from `mindstorms`.
